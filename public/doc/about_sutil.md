## What is Sutil

Sutil was originally named Sveltish, and that's because it was inspired by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

Sutil's features are:

- Feliz-flavoured DOM builder
- No dependencies
- No React
- Cool transitions
- Reactivity based on IObservable and Stores
- Component styling

Sutil is currently in alpha, which means it's safe enough for you to play around with, but expect
breaking changes.

*(more coming soon, I'm actively working on building this doc tree into the example app)*
